### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer emphasizing **automated testing** and writing **APIs that are a joy to use**, primarily using [Swift](https://swift.org).

## Observability for server-side Swift ðŸ”­

I participated in [Google Summer of Code 2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/6305735463403520/
), working on a new set of libraries to trace distributed systems written in Swift.

Since then, I open-sourced related libraries such as [slashmo/swift-otel](https://github.com/slashmo/swift-otel).

- [apple/swift-distributed-tracing](https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing)
- [apple/swift-service-context](https://github.com/apple/swift-service-context)
- [Swift Forums: Current state of Swift Tracing](https://forums.swift.org/t/current-state-of-swift-tracing/39830)
