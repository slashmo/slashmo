### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer emphasizing **automated testing** and writing **APIs that are a joy to use**, primarily using [Swift](https://swift.org).

## Swift Distributed Tracing ðŸ”­

In 2020 I enjoyed participating in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/6305735463403520/
), working on a new set of libraries to trace distributed systems written in Swift. Since then, I open-sourced many related libraries such as [slashmo/opentelemetry-swift](https://github.com/slashmo/opentelemetry-swift) and [slashmo/jaeger-client-swift](https://github.com/slashmo/jaeger-client-swift).

## Bachelor at CODE University of Applied Sciences ðŸŽ“

In 2017, I joined the then newly founded [CODE University](https://code.berlin) as a Software Engineering student. With a strong emphasis on project-based learning, I enjoyed working on many projects with my fellow students, from Product Managers to Interaction Designers and Software Engineers. My personal highlight was a project called ANYVR. In a team of 8 (1 PM / 2 ID / 5 SE), we created a VR-based collaboration tool to enable remote teams to work in rooms with tools like 3D pens and whiteboards. My part was defining and implementing the protocol for real-time player movement and tool usage, based on [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers). I currently work towards finishing my bachelor thesis this year, writing about - you guessed it - [Distributed Tracing](#swift-distributed-tracing-).
